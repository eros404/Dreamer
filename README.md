UI Interface built with Electron to use DeepDaze and VQGAN-CLIP

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

## Deep Daze

Deep Daze is a simple command line tool for text to image generation using OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) [Siren](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661).

It is created by Phil Wang ([@lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains)), you can found the source repository [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/deep-daze).

### Requirements

This will require that you have an **Nvidia GPU or AMD GPU**

- Recommended: 16GB VRAM
- Minimum Requirements: 4GB VRAM (using VERY LOW settings)

## Project status

- [ ] Deep Daze generation
    - [x] with text/image
    - [ ] story mode
    - [x] generation visualization and process status
- [ ] VQGAN+CLIP generation
- [ ] Image explorer
    - [ ] realsr implementation for upscaling
