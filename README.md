UI Interface built with Electron to use DeepDaze and VQGAN-CLIP

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

## Download

- [Pre-release v0.1.0](https://github.com/eros404/Dreamer/releases/download/v0.1.0/dreamer-win32-x64.zip)

## Deep Daze

Deep Daze is a simple command line tool for text to image generation using OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) [Siren](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661).

It is created by Phil Wang ([@lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains)), you can found the source repository [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/deep-daze).

### Requirements

This will require that you have an **Nvidia GPU or AMD GPU**

- Recommended: 16GB VRAM
- Minimum Requirements: 4GB VRAM (using VERY LOW settings)
